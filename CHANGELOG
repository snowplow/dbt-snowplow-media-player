snowplow-media-player 0.5.0 (2023-03-29)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrate our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top.  The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` :
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

### Redshift/Postgres custom contexts
The change in de-duplication logic means that now the `events_this_run` table from the web model and downstream tables will contain events that may have duplicates within your self-describing-events or context tables. Previously these events were discarded do there was no risk of duplication when joining a sde/context in a custom model, you must now make sure to de-dupe your sde/context before joining in any custom models. See the docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#guidelines--best-practice).

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Change de-duplication logic on redshift/postgres

## Docs
- Update readme
