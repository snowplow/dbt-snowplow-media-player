snowplow-media-player 0.9.3 (2025-07-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release introduces the requirement for the user to explicitly accept the snowplow user license.

## Features
- A new boolean variable `snowplow__license_accepted` has been introduced in the main dbt package's `dbt_project.yml` file.
- The default value of variable `snowplow__license_accepted` has been set to `false`.
- To use this dbt package, the user is required accept the Snowplow Personal and Academic License or have a commercial agreement with Snowplow. See: https://docs.snowplow.io/personal-and-academic-license-1.0.
- To accept, the user needs to set variable `snowplow__license_accepted` to `true` in their project's `dbt_project.yml`.

## Upgrading  
Update the snowplow-media-player version in your packages.yml file.

snowplow-media-player 0.9.2 (2024-12-10)
---------------------------------------
## Summary  
This feature release introduces dynamic aggregation for passthrough fields in ad_views, allowing greater flexibility in managing session-level analytics.

## Features  

**- Dynamic Aggregation for Passthrough Fields:**
  Introduced the ability to apply optional aggregation logic (e.g., MAX, MIN) to passthrough fields in the media_player_media_ad_views model. This feature prevents cardinality violations while maintaining compatibility for non-aggregation fields.
**Example configuration:**
```yaml
snowplow__ad_views_passthroughs: [
  "v_collector",
  {"sql": "v_tracker || app_id", "alias": "tracker_app_id", "agg": "max"},
  {"sql": "v_collector", "alias": "v_collector_alias", "agg": "min"}
]
```

This is an optional feature and can be implemented if required by your use case.

## Upgrading  

Update the snowplow-media-player version in your packages.yml file.

snowplow-media-player 0.9.1 (2024-10-23)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This patch release adds app_id as a new field in some of the derived tables and includes a bug fix related to user identification handling in ad_views.

## Features
- Introduced app_id field across some of the derived tables to improve application-level analytics

## Fix
- Optimized user_id aggregation, changed from GROUP BY to MAX(user_id) in queries in ad_view, because it could cause duplicates in an edge case.

## Upgrading
To upgrade, update the snowplow-media-player version in your `packages.yml` file. Please note:
- The new app_id field will be populated for new data points automatically
- Although this is a non-breaking change, historical data will require a [full refresh](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/full-or-partial-refreshes/) to include app_id values, if needed

snowplow-media-player 0.9.0 (2024-10-15)

snowplow-media-player 0.8.0 (2024-06-20)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds support for video playback across multiple pages/screens (e.g., while in picture-in-picture mode).
It also fixes the calculation of impressions in the stats table to use distinct plays instead of page views. This allows for multiple videos on the same page.

## Features
- Add support for picture-in-picture playback of videos across multiple pages/screens (#70)

## Fix
- Fix counting impressions based using distinct play_id instead of page_view_id (#72)

## Under the hood
- Run tests on Redshift in CI (#74)

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
This version requires a full refresh run if you have been using any previous versions. Otherwise the calculation of the `impressions` and `play_rate` columns in the media stats table will be inconsistent with historical data. Check out the [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/media-player/) for more information when you upgrade.

snowplow-media-player 0.7.2 (2024-03-18)

snowplow-media-player 0.7.0 (2023-12-07)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds new features powered by a complete refactor of the core processing of the package by moving it out to the new `base` macro functionality provided in `snowplow_utils`. This enables users to now specify custom fields for sessionization and user identification, to add custom entities/SDEs fields to the base events table for redshift/postgres, and to add passthrough fields to the derived tables so you can now more easily add your own fields to our tables.

The default session identifier has been updated from using the domain_sessionid, to now be the media session id (or the page/screen view id if the media session entity is not set). Previously media events from a play that overlapped to a new domain_sessionid were discarded, this update ensures the complete media play is modeled. It is still possible to perform the original session level analysis using the new `domain_sessionid_array` field.

In addition this release adds a more robust unique media identifier. This fixes an issue where duplicate `media_id` values could occur in the media stats table as a result of incorrect tracking implementation (e.g. sharing the same media label across different media types). This release also fixes the incremental materialization of the media_ad_views table by adding a unique primary key.

## Features
- Migrate base models to the new `base` macros for flexibility and consistency
- Updated the default session identifier be the media session id (or page/screen view id if the media session entity is not set)
- Add ability to pass fields through to derived media base and ad views tables
- Add new field `domain_sessionid_array` to derived tables (where applicable)

## Fixes
- Add unique media identifier (close #59)
- Add missing primary key to media_ad_views
- Fix field names in custom session stats model yaml (close #63)
- Fix playback_quality_field macro (close #60)

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
This version requires a full refresh run if you have been using any previous versions. You will not be able to upgrade and have the package work without doing a full refresh.

snowplow-media-player 0.5.0 (2023-03-29)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrate our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top.  The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` :
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

### Redshift/Postgres custom contexts
The change in de-duplication logic means that now the `events_this_run` table from the web model and downstream tables will contain events that may have duplicates within your self-describing-events or context tables. Previously these events were discarded do there was no risk of duplication when joining a sde/context in a custom model, you must now make sure to de-dupe your sde/context before joining in any custom models. See the docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#guidelines--best-practice).

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Change de-duplication logic on redshift/postgres

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-media-player version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/media-player/#upgrading-to-0140)
