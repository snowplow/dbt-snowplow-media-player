snowplow-media-player 0.7.0 (2023-xx-xx)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds new features powered by a complete refactor of the core processing of the package by moving it out to the new `base` macro functionality provided in `snowplow_utils`. This enables users to now specify custom fields for sessionization and user identification, to add custom entities/SDEs fields to the base events table for redshift/postgres, and to add passthrough fields to the derived tables so you can now more easily add your own fields to our tables.

The default session identifier has been updated from using the domain_sessionid, to now be the media session id (or the page/screen view id if the media session entity is not set). Previously media events from a play that overlapped to a new domain_sessionid were discarded, this update ensures the complete media play is modeled. It is still possible to perform the original session level analysis using the new `domain_sessionid_array` field.

In addition this release adds a more robust unique media identifier. This fixes an issue where duplicate `media_id` values could occur in the media stats table as a result of incorrect tracking implementation (e.g. sharing the same media label across different media types). This release also fixes the incremental materialization of the media_ad_views table by adding a unique primary key.

## Features
- Migrate base models to the new `base` macros for flexibility and consistency
- Updated the default session identifier be the media session id (or page/screen view id if the media session entity is not set)
- Add ability to pass fields through to derived media base and ad views tables
- Add new field `domain_sessionid_array` to derived tables (where applicable)

## Fixes
- Add unique media identifier (close #59)
- Add missing primary key to media_ad_views
- Fix field names in custom session stats model yaml (close #63)

snowplow-media-player 0.5.0 (2023-03-29)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrate our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top.  The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` :
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

### Redshift/Postgres custom contexts
The change in de-duplication logic means that now the `events_this_run` table from the web model and downstream tables will contain events that may have duplicates within your self-describing-events or context tables. Previously these events were discarded do there was no risk of duplication when joining a sde/context in a custom model, you must now make sure to de-dupe your sde/context before joining in any custom models. See the docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#guidelines--best-practice).

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Change de-duplication logic on redshift/postgres

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-media-player version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/media-player/#upgrading-to-0140)
