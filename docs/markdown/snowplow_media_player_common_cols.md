{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_playback_quality %}
Depending on the player it is either the playback quality field or the resolution.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_percent_progress %}
The percent of the way through the media. It is based on either the percentprogress event that is fired at specific intervalls as defined during the tracker setup or the 'ended' event, which is equivalent to reaching 100% of the media's total duration (length). e.g. 25, meaning the user passed the 25% mark during play. It does not mean the user watched all the content in between two percentprogress marks, unless there is no seek events happening within the same page_view (`snowplow_media_player_base`).
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_percent_progress_reached %}
An array of percent progresses reached by the user while playing the media. In case the same percentprogress event was fired during the same page_view (e.g. due to seeks to rewatch part of the video) the % is added to the array again. e.g. in case of percent_progress_reached = [10, 25, 25, 50, 75] the user replayed part of the media so that the percentprogress event fired twice at the 25% mark.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_play_time_secs %}
Total seconds user spent playing content (excluding linear ads). If the media session entity is tracked with media events, the information is read from there. This is an accurate measurement provided by the tracker.

 This also counts playback of rewatched content (see `content_watched_secs` for a measurement without considering rewatched content).

If the media session entity is not tracked, the value is estimated. It is calculated using the percent_progress events that are fired during play. In case such an event is fired, it is assumed that the total section of the media in between the previous and current percent_progress is played through, even if the user seeks to another point in time within the audio / video. The more often these events are tracked (e.g. every 5% of the media's length) the more accurate the calculation becomes.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_paused_time_secs %}

If the media session context entity is tracked with events, the information is taken from there which makes it more accurate since it is calculated on the tracker. If the media session entity is not tracked (when using our older tracking plugins or when it is disabled on the tracker), this property will be null.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_avg_content_watched_mins %}
Average duration of the content played in minutes. Each part of the content played is counted once (i.e., counts rewinding or rewatching the same content only once).

Field(s) calculated based on the `snowplow_mp_percent_progress` list, which shows how many times a certain percent progress has been reached. Please note that `100_percent_reached` = 1 does not necessarily mean that one user has played the media fully, but that there was either an 'ended' event or a 'percentprogress' event with a value of 100 and the user could still have seeked just before the end. If the same user replays part of the media during the same page_view, it will be counted in the total number.
