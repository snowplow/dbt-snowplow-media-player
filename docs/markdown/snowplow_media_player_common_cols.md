{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_playback_quality %}
Depending on the player it is either the playback quality field or the resolution.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_percent_progress %}
The percent of the way through the media. It is based on either the percentprogress event that is fired at specific intervalls as defined during the tracker setup or the 'ended' event, which is equivalent to reaching 100% of the media's total duration (length). e.g. 25, meaning the user passed the 25% mark during play. It does not mean the user watched all the content in between two percentprogress marks, unless there is no seek events happening within the same page_view (`snowplow_media_player_base`).
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_percent_progress_reached %}
An array of percent progresses reached by the user while playing the media. In case the same percentprogress event was fired during the same page_view (e.g. due to seeks to rewatch part of the video) the % is added to the array again. e.g. in case of percent_progress_reached = [10, 25, 25, 50, 75] the user replayed part of the media so that the percentprogress event fired twice at the 25% mark.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_is_muted %}
If the media is muted during the event that is fired.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_start_tstamp %}
The `derived_tstamp` denoting the time when the event started.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_end_tstamp %}
The `derived_tstamp` denoting the time when the last media player event belonging to the specific level of aggregation (e.g.: page_view by media) started.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_play_time_sec %}
Estimated duration of play in seconds. It is calculated using the percent_progress events that are fired during play. In case such an event is fired, it is assumed that the total section of the media in between the previous and current percent_progress is played through, even if the user seeks to another point in time within the audio / video. The more often these events are tracked (e.g. every 5% of the media's length) the more accurate the calculation becomes.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_avg_play_time_min %}
Estimated average duration of plays in minutes.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_avg_play_time_sec %}
Estimated average duration of plays in seconds.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_first_play %}

{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_impressions %}
The number of pageviews where a media content was rendered regardless of whether the media was actually played or not.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_avg_playback_rate %}
Average playback rate (1 is normal speed).
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_play_rate %}
Total plays divided by impressions. Please note that as the base for media plays is pageview / media_id, in case the same video is played multiple times within the same pageview, it will still count as one play.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_complete_plays %}
The number of plays where the total percentage played is bigger than or equal to the `snowplow__complete_play_rate`. Default is 0.99, meaning that 99% of the video being watched constitutes a complete play.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_completion_rate_by_plays %}
The number of complete plays divided by the number of pageviews with plays of any duration.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_retention_rate %}
The maximum percent progress reached before any seek event.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_avg_percent_played %}
Average of total play_time divided by the media duration.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col__percent_reached %}
Field(s) calculated based on the `snowplow_mp_percent_progress` list, which shows how many times a certain percent progress has been reached. Please note that `100_percent_reached` = 1 does not necessarily mean that one user has played the media fully, but that there was either an 'ended' event or a 'percentprogress' event with a value of 100 and the user could still have seeked just before the end. If the same user replays part of the media during the same page_view, it will be counted in the total number.
{% enddocs %}

{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_play_time_sec_muted %}
Calculated duration of muted play in seconds. It is based on the percent_progress event and whether the user played it on mute during this event or not.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_is_played %}

{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_is_valid_play %}
A boolean value to show whether the duration of the play (`play_time_sec`) is bigger than or equal to the variable given in `snowplow__valid_play_sec` (defaulted to 30).
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_is_complete_play %}
A boolean value to show whether the total percentage played is bigger than or equal to the `snowplow__complete_play_rate` (defaulted to 0.99).
